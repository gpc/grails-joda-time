# Joda-Time Plugin

The Joda-Time Plugin integrates the [Joda-Time][1] date/time library into Grails. The plugin...

* Bundles the libraries necessary to use _Joda Time_ types as persistent fields on domain classes.
* Provides the ability to bind from form inputs to _Joda Time_ fields on domain or command objects.
* Supports _JSON_ and _XML_ rendering of _Joda Time_ types.
* Provides tag-libs for input and output of _Joda Time_ data.
* Enhances Grails' scaffolding to support domain classes with _Joda Time_ fields.
* Adds compatibility and consistency methods to _Joda Time_ types so that they integrate better with Groovy.
